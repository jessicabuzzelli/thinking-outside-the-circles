### Warning:
This repo is set to private so only people added as contributors can view. Even though it's private, please don't upload the data file to the repo just in case!

### Structure: 
My repo has a folder called ```data``` that contains the data spreadsheet. I've set up our ```.gitignore``` to ignore this file so that the data is not pushed to the repo if you are using GitHub desktop. If you use this structure, the notebooks should work. If not, they will error on the first cell and you will have to modify the file loading path to wherever you have the data stored on your laptop.
